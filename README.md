[##] User Experience

[##] Goals of Site

[##] Structure
This site has 3 pages and a sign in modal.

[###] Navbar
The navbar has two active links, to the contact us page and the sign in page modal. The company name works as the link back to the homepage. In the future, the buy, rent and sell page would all be linked up.

[###] Home Page
-The homepage has 3 main sections. The introduction at the top which contains the company name, along with some buttons for user friendliness.
-Underneath that comes the highlight properties section. These are top properties chosen by our professional team for showcase to prospective customers.
-Further down comes the new to market area, where properties again are shown in order of which they are added to the market. In the future this would update daily with the newest properties being shown.
-At the bottom of the page is our office locations. These are the 2 current locations of the company. In future I would use a google maps add on to show the locations.

[###] Contact us
-The contact us page is set up for customers to query regarding house sales, and also request viewings for both purchase and let properties.
-The option for these three scenarios are provided in the drop down box along with all the other neccessary info needed.

[###] Home 1
-This is the first showcase of a home for this page, it can be accessed by using the view property button on the homepage for any of the property cards. In future when these are all linked it would just be the corresponding property.
-This page contains a carousel of the images of the property with a description below and sales pitch for the home. Below this is some important information regarding the property.


[##] Design

[###] Colour Scheme
The main colour scheme was white for the header and footer, and whitesmoke for the body of the pages.
The main colour scheme for the text of the webpage was darkseagreen and black.
These schemes offer contrasting shades so everything stands out in a professional design.

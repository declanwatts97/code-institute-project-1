## Introduction

Welcome to DW Property & Holdings, the North East's newest estate agent. We are looking to give you the best options of homes new to the market for both sale and rental, with our expert team also ready to assist you with selling your home. Explore our site for hand picked properties, for all of your needs.

## User Experience

### User Requirements

The primary users of DW Property and Lettings are people looking to either buy or sell their homes. This includes a wide range of ages and backgrounds who all have one common need, to buy or sell their homes. This means that the main priorities are to show current houses on the market, show premium houses which may invoke a sale easier than some others, and to give them the option to speak to our team and arrange a valuatiom.

## User Stories
## Website Visitors

All user stories are linked back to the github project planning stage

- As a user, I require the web page to be user friendly and responsive so I can navigate the site easily and find exactly what I'm looking for. I require it to be responsive so I can view all relevant information to the potential houses I am looking at.
- As a user, I must be able to clearly view images of potential houses, giving me an accurate representation of what they look like in person.
- As a user, I require the facility to sign in to my account while viewing houses, so I can save any that I am interested in for ease of future access. Through this feature I would also set up alerts for new houses added to the market. 
- As a user, when I have found a house I like, I must be able to easily access the contact information of the estate agents so I can arrange viewings, send enquiries or visit the business premises.

## Goals of Site

- The goal of the website from a business stand point is to create an engaging and well designed site which encourages the customers to view properties giving them enough information to potentially want to come and view/create a sale.
- The goal of the website is to provide both rental and sale properties, to cross over both sides of the market and ensure all demands are being met.
- The goal of the website is to allow customers to log in, and save any properties which they would like to view or have viewed previously. It will make the house hunting process far easier with everything stored in one place.
- The goal of the website is to ensure a high level of user friendliness and ease of navigation.

## Structure

This site has 3 pages and a sign in modal.

### Navbar

- The navbar has two active links, to the contact us page and the sign in page modal. The company name works as the link back to the homepage. In the future, the buy, rent and sell page would all be linked up.

### Home Page

- The homepage has 3 main sections. The introduction at the top which contains the company name, along with some buttons for user friendliness.
- Underneath that comes the highlight properties section. These are top properties chosen by our professional team for showcase to prospective customers.
- Further down comes the new to market area, where properties again are shown in order of which they are added to the market. In the future this would update daily with the newest properties being shown.
- At the bottom of the page is our office locations. These are the 2 current locations of the company. In future I would use a google maps add on to show the locations.

### Contact us
- The contact us page is set up for customers to query regarding house sales, and also request viewings for both purchase and let properties.
- The option for these three scenarios are provided in the drop down box along with all the other neccessary info needed.

### Home 1
- This is the first showcase of a home for this page, it can be accessed by using the view property button on the homepage for any of the property cards. In future when these are all linked it would just be the corresponding property.
- This page contains a carousel of the images of the property with a description below and sales pitch for the home. Below this is some important information regarding the property.


## Design

### Colour Scheme
- The main colour scheme was white for the header and footer, and whitesmoke for the body of the pages.
- The main colour scheme for the text of the webpage was darkseagreen and black.
- These schemes offer contrasting shades so everything stands out in a professional design.
